# Note about Tornado 3:
#
# Futures were introduced in Python 3 in the `concurrent.futures` package.
# This package has also been backported to older versions of Python and can be
# installed with `pip install futures`. Tornado 3 on Python 2 uses
# concurrent.futures if available; otherwise it will use a compatible class
# defined in tornado.concurrent.
#
# Tornado 4 always uses its own futures.
