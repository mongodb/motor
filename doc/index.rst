About
-----

Motor presents a Tornado_ callback- or Future-based API for non-blocking access
to MongoDB. The `source is on GitHub <https://github.com/mongodb/motor>`_ and
the docs are on `ReadTheDocs <http://motor.readthedocs.org/>`_.

    "Motor uses a clever greenlet-based approach to fully support both
    synchronous and asynchronous interfaces from a single codebase. It's great
    to see companies like MongoDB produce first-party asynchronous drivers for
    their products."

    --*Ben Darnell, Tornado maintainer*

Install with::

    $ pip install motor
