About
=====

Motor presents a Tornado_callback- or Future-based API for non-blocking access
to MongoDB. The source is `on GitHub <https://github.com/mongodb/motor>`_
and the docs are on ReadTheDocs_.

    "Motor uses a clever greenlet-based approach to fully support both
    synchronous and asynchronous interfaces from a single codebase. It's great
    to see companies like 10gen produce first-party asynchronous drivers for
    their products."

    --*Ben Darnell, Tornado maintainer*

Issues / Questions / Feedback
=============================

Any issues with, questions about, or feedback for Motor should be sent to the
mongodb-user list on Google Groups. For confirmed issues or feature requests,
open a case on `jira <http://jira.mongodb.org>`_ in the "MOTOR" project.

Installation
============

  $ pip install motor

Dependencies
============

Motor works in all the environments officially supported by Tornado_. It
requires:

* Unix, including Mac OS X. Microsoft Windows is not officially supported.
* PyMongo_
* Tornado_
* Greenlet_
* CPython 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, or 3.3
* PyPy 2.0 (greenlets were very slow in earlier PyPy versions)

Additional dependencies are:

- (to generate documentation) sphinx_
- (to run tests) nose_

Documentation
=============

You will need sphinx_ installed to generate the documentation. Documentation
can be generated by running ``python setup.py doc``. Generated documentation
can be found in ``doc/build/html/``. You can read the current docs
at ReadTheDocs_.

Examples
========

See the `examples on ReadTheDocs <https://motor.readthedocs.org/en/latest/examples/index.html>`_
or `Chirp, a dumb Twitter clone <https://github.com/ajdavis/chirp>`_.

Testing
=======

The easiest way to run the tests is to install nose_ and run ``nosetests``
in the root of the distribution.

You can run all the tests in Python 3 with ``python setup.py nosetests``. Due
to a `nose bug`_, running a subset of the tests in Python 3 is complicated.
Build Motor and its tests with Python 3, then ``cd`` to the build directory and
run ``nosetests``::

  $ python3.3 setup.py build --test
  using 2to3
  including test modules
  running build
  running build_py
  creating build/lib/motor
  ...
  $ cd build/lib
  $ nosetests-3.3 test.test_motor_client
