About
=====

Motor presents a Tornado_callback- or Future-based API for non-blocking access
to MongoDB. The source is `on GitHub <https://github.com/mongodb/motor>`_
and the docs are on ReadTheDocs_.

    "Motor uses a clever greenlet-based approach to fully support both
    synchronous and asynchronous interfaces from a single codebase. It's great
    to see companies like MongoDB produce first-party asynchronous drivers for
    their products."

    --*Ben Darnell, Tornado maintainer*
