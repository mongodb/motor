About
=====

Motor presents a Tornado_callback- or Future-based API for non-blocking access
to MongoDB. The source is `on GitHub <https://github.com/mongodb/motor>`_
and the docs are on ReadTheDocs_.

    "Motor uses a clever greenlet-based approach to fully support both
    synchronous and asynchronous interfaces from a single codebase. It's great
    to see companies like MongoDB produce first-party asynchronous drivers for
    their products."

    --*Ben Darnell, Tornado maintainer*

Installation
============

  $ pip install motor

Dependencies
============

Motor works in all the environments officially supported by Tornado_. It
requires:

* Unix, including Mac OS X. Windows is not supported.
* PyMongo_
* Tornado_
* Greenlet_
* Python 2.6 or later.
* `backports.pbkdf2`_ for faster authentication with MongoDB 3.0+,
  especially on Python older than 2.7.8, or on Python 3 before Python 3.4.

See "Requirements" for details about compatibility.
